	 <h2> What Is Your Passion?</h2>
	  <p>Have you discovered your passion yet? If not, what are you waiting for? If you have already discovered it, what are you doing about it? Have you ever wondered what it takes to follow a passion? Or maybe you have been pensively contemplating why the divine and supreme being has given the passions and talents that you possess? These and many other such questions have been preoccupying my thoughts for about six years now. So as a result of the longevity of the time it took me to come to peace terms with myself in this respect, I concluded that I was going to tell the world about the same intrapersonal struggle that I assume countless individuals are going through. </p>
	  <h2> Why Do You Possess The Passion(s) That You Have?</h2>
	   <p> This website ventures to assist you in finding your passions and talents, discover why you have been endowed with such specific passions or talents, as well as to kick start you into starting what you think might be the primary reason as to why those flairs were bestowed to you. My solutions and suggestions are based on Biblical values and principles as the world outside my Christian faith is sheer chaos. One does not necessarily have to be a Christian to be able to explore my ideas; however, one should be an adherent of a supreme being in order to be able to look at his or her extra extraordinary abilities through the lenses that I have to offer in this precise yet sententious site. Tighten your belt a notch for the journey is about to get underway. In fact the journey is only a click away. Do you dare to make the move? Remember that the world is no longer kind enough to always grant the desires of our hearts without us knuckling down to make the grade with flying colors. The world no longer contains space for weaklings. The adventure into the unknown begins so prove yourself tough when it gets rough. Let us hit the road! </p>
	   <h2> Every Part Of The Journey Counts </h2>
	    <p>I do possess several talents. Some I do not even know yet. By this I am referring to things that I can do very well regardless of the amount of time I put in practice. For instance, I had dozens of people come to me and profess hat when I lead(e.g. Bible Study, Study Group, Discussion Groups, panels, Get Together, etc.) it comes effortlessly for the participants and povo(people of various opinions) to make sense and eke out some meaning of what is happening. They enjoy the sessions and the comprehension level is superb. That is the chief task of those who take upon their shoulders the responsibility to educate â€“ bring the concepts to the level that learners will grasp. Some have purported that they will have no dilemmas listening to me for ages while I speak about just any topic. This group of people categorizes me with stand up comedians. A few other talents remain yet unveiled. However, much of this website will be dedicated to my flair when it comes to track and field events as well as the creation of a jolly atmosphere. These are passions! For instance, when in a football pitch, I am tempted to believe that life on earth will never end. For me, personally, soccer is not all about the unquantified decibels emitted by the jubilant and colorful crowd of fans, but it encompasses something as simple as my reception of a humble pass and how I dismiss the ball perfectly with acute judgement as it flies from one segment of the field to the opposite side. It is true that maximum support is synonymous with maximum performance, but I must admit that it is also veritable that it is not only the destination that matters, but also the journey itself. </p>
		<h2>Passion vs. Talent</h2>
		 <p>It is my conviction that by now, you must have identified your passions and talents or at least have detected some threads that could lead to its discovery. By now I assume it is more appropriate to ask if you know where to draw the line between a talent and a passion? How sharp is that line? A talent is a special skill that God has bestowed you with. This special skill makes it possible for you to attain certain objectives effortlessly. A passion, however, is not only skills you enjoy employing, it is the one that gives you life. Like I mentioned earlier, when I play soccer I feel alive, in effect I become alive. That is a passion! Now that I have discovered my passion, what could be the chief reason why God gave me that particular passion and how can I use it fairly?</p>
		 <h2>Are You Employing Your Passion(s) Fairly?</h2>

Anything that you do that always makes you feel happy and alive is your passion. Follow it. You do not necessarily have to have a very thick wallet to follow a passion; it take a willing heart. May it always be at the back of your mind that the fruits of your talents and/or passions can actually benefit the less fortunated and the less privileged. </p>
